description: |
  Nagios is a host/service/network monitoring and management system.  The
  purpose of this addon is to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on a
  remote host in as transparent a manner as possible.  This program runs
  as a background process on the remote host and processes command
  execution requests from the check_nrpe plugin on the Nagios host.
