This charm provides an nrpe subordinate to integrate with nagios logging.

Adding the charm as a subordinate to a service will run an nrpe server
on the unit and allow for nagios to query the service using that server.

The service provides a 'local-monitors' container scoped interface
to define the plugins that the nrpe server can use. The charm should
'relation-set monitors=monitors' with a monitors.yaml in the same
format as the 'monitors' relation seen in the nagios charm. This will
be merged with the base monitors and any monitors configured via the
monitors setting from config.yaml.
