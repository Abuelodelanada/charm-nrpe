This charm provides an nrpe subordinate to integrate with nagios logging.

Adding the charm as a subordinate to a service will run an nrpe server
on the unit and allow for nagios to query the service using that
server.

The service provides a 'nagios-plugins' interface to define the plugins
that the nrpe server can use. The charm should 'relation-set nagios-plugins'
with a list of "NAME COMMAND" pairs for the plugins. The name is a short
string to identify the check, conventially starting with "check_". The
command is the command to run to perform the check.

How the nagios server is instructed to monitor that check for the host
is yet to be defined.
